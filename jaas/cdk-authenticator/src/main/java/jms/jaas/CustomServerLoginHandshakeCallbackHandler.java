/**
 * A {@link CallbackHandler} which will handle callbacks that are issued when the server is negotiating a
 * connection authentication with the client.
 * <p/>
 * This callback handler will first check if a client side JAAS login has already been performed and if it hasn't
 * then it will issue a {@link javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext#login()} during the callback handling. Once
 * the client side login completes, this callback handler then uses the APIs provided by Picketbox to fetch the
 * logged in principal and credentials. This principal and credentials are then passed on to the server via the callbacks.
 * <p/>
 * A typical flow where this callback handler comes into picture is as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Client application boots</li>
 *     <li>EJB client API find a jboss-ejb-client.properties in the classpath and starts creating EJB receivers out of it</li>
 *     <li>The EJB receiver creation triggers a connection request to the server which is secured</li>
 *     <li>The secure server then starts negotiating with the incoming client connection request for authentication credentials
 *          via the {@link Callback}s
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Since this callback handler is configured in the jboss-ejb-client.properties the EJB client API instantiates
 *          an instance of this class and lets it handle the {@link Callback}s from the server
 *     </li>
 *     <li>This callback handler in its {@link #handle(javax.security.auth.callback.Callback[])} method then checks
 *          if there's already been a client side (JAAS) login. It uses the Picketbox APIs to get to that info.
 *          If there hasn't yet been a login, then it triggers a JAAS {@link javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext#login()}
 *          which uses our configured <code>auth.conf</code> JAAS login module stack which looks like this:
 *          <code>
 *              myapp-jaas-stack{
 *                  org.jboss.security.ClientLoginModule required;
 *              };
 *          </code>
 *          So the JAAS login module stack is configured to just use the org.jboss.security.ClientLoginModule which
 *          doesn't really do any authentication but just sets up the security context with whatever callback information
 *          the {@link ClientLoginCallbackHandler} provided.
 *          Note that the login module stack need not just contain the org.jboss.security.ClientLoginModule, it might
 *          have other login modules too which might do actual client side authentication.
 *          During this login process, the JAAS login module uses our {@link ClientLoginCallbackHandler} since that's what
 *          we have passed on to the constructor of {@link LoginContext} in our {@link #doJaasLogin()} method. See the javadoc
 *          of {@link ClientLoginCallbackHandler} for more details on it
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Once the login process (if at all it was initiated) completes successfully in this callback handler, this callback
 *         handler then uses Picketbox APIs to fetch the {@link Principal} and credential of the logged-in user and
 *         uses that information to setup the {@link Callback}s it has been handling. This information that has now
 *         been setup in the {@link Callback}s will then be available to the server side during the authentication
 *         negotiating and if they pass the rules, the connection creation succeeds and ultimately a EJB receiver
 *         capabale of handling requests to EJBs deployed on the server will be created and registered in the EJB client
 *         context for this client application
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
